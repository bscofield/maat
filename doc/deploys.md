## Process
* Failed CI blocks deploys
* Passed CI builds an image and continuously deploys to a QA environment
* Manual depoys (to production) can be initiated from the command line or the web UI
* Deploys create tags in git
* Deployed servers are tagged and named according to role, content, and environment

## Rollback
* Deploys are easily rollbackable

## Configuration
* Configuration stored with the application
* Attach to load balancer automatically OR update internal DNS automatically
* Call out to config server for required settings and for registration

## Changelogs
* Autogenerated on deploy with commits included, easy link to diffs between current and old deployed code

## Monitoring
* Deploys are tracked -- both as events and for performance (to keep to our target deploy speeds, etc.)
