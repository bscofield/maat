# Maat


I want to run an infrastructure with fast, safe deploys, extensive automation, visibility into what people and the automated systems do, and flexibility and extensibility.

I believe that the best way to realize this desire is through immutable infrastructure and well-coded tools.

Maat is my attempt to create it.

For now, this will mostly be a repository of thoughts and ideas.

## Naming

[Maat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat) was the (sometimes personified as a goddess) concept of Order for the ancient Egyptians. She / it stands opposed to chaos.
