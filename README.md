# Maat


I want to run an infrastructure that provides fast, safe deploys, is extensively automated, gives visibility into what people and the automated systems do, and is flexible, extensible, and easy to understand.

I believe that the best way to realize this desire is through immutable infrastructure and well-coded tools.

Maat is my attempt to create it.

For now, this will mostly be a repository of thoughts and ideas.

## Naming

[Maat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat) was the (sometimes personified as a goddess) concept of Order for the ancient Egyptians. She / it stands opposed to chaos.
